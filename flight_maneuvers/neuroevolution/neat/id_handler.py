class IdHandler:
    """ Handles the assignment of IDs.

    An ID handler manages the assignment of IDs to species, genomes, hidden
    nodes and connections. In the case of nodes and connections genes, the ID
    can also be interpreted as an innovation number.

    "The innovation numbers are historical markers that identify the original
    historical ancestor of each gene. New genes are assigned new increasingly
    higher numbers." - :cite:`stanley:ec02`

    The ID handler implements the following solution:

    "A possible problem is that the same structural innovation will receive
    different innovation numbers in the same generation if it occurs by chance
    more than once. However, by keeping a list of the innovations that occurred
    in the current generation, it is possible to ensure that when the same
    structure arises more than once through independent mutations in the same
    generation, each identical mutation is assigned the same innovation number.
    Thus, there is no resultant explosion of innovation numbers." -
    :cite:`stanley:ec02`

    In `flight_maneuvers.evolution`, it's possible to configure the rate at which innovation numbers
    are reset (see :attr:`.NeatConfig.reset_innovations_period`).
