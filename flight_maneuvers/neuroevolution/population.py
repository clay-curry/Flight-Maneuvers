class GeneticPopulation(BasePopulation):
    """ Implementation of a generalizable genetic algorithm.

    This class implements a generalizable genetic algorithm that can be used by
    different neuroevolution algorithms. The algorithm is used to evolve a
    population of genomes (instances of a subclass of :class:`.BaseGenome`).

    This class does not make strong assumptions about the type of genome it is
    dealing with, so it does not take into account the type of encoding the
    genome uses or how it processes input. This allows the implemented algorithm
    to be used in a wide range of scenarios.

    The implemented genetic algorithm uses (optionally) a speciation scheme
    similar to the one used by the NEAT algorithm :cite:`stanley:ec02`. The
    computation of the distance between the genomes, however, is not implemented
    here, but on the subclass that implements class:`.BaseGenome`.

    When subclassing this class, you probably won't need to override the
    :meth:`.GeneticPopulation.evolve` method, which contains the main loop of
    the genetic algorithm.

    To better understand the default behaviour of the algorithm, it's
    recommended to read the docs of the methods :meth:`.speciate` and
    :meth:`.reproduction`.

    Example:

        Example using :class:`.FixedTopologyGenome` as the base genome type:

        .. code-block:: python

            def fitness_func(genome):
                \"\"\"
                Function that takes a genome as input and returns the genome's
                fitness (a float) as output.
                \"\"\"
                # ...

        First, the fittest genomes of each species with more than a pre-defined
        number of individuals are selected to be copied unchanged to the next
        generation (elitism). Next, the least fit genomes of each species are
        discarded (reverse elitism). After that, the number of descendants of
        each species is calculated. The number of offspring assigned to each
        species is proportional to the average fitness of the species
        (`roulette wheel selection`). Finally, the reproduction of individuals
        of the same species (and, on rare occasions, between genomes of
        different species as well) occurs.

        Genomes with a higher fitness have a higher chance of leaving offspring.
        Within a species, the chance of a genome reproducing is given by the
        position it occupies in the species fitness rank
        (`rank-based selection`). This means that the reproduction chance of a
        genome is not directly calculated from the genome's fitness, but rather
        from how well positioned is the genome in the fitness rank.

        Some of the behaviour described above follows the original description
        of the NEAT algorithm :cite:`stanley:ec02`.

        Newborn genomes have a chance of being "eaten by a predator", in which
        case they are replaced by new randomly generated genomes. This technique
        is called `predatism`.
