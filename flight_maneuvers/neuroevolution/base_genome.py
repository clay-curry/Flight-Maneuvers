evolutionary process. It encodes a neural network (the genome's phenotype),
either directly or indirectly.

    This class must be inherited by all the different classes of genomes present
    in `flight_maneuvers.evolution`

    In the context of neuroevolution, a genome is the entity subject to the
    evolutionary process. It encodes a neural network (the genome's phenotype),
    either directly or indirectly.

    As pointed out by :cite:`stanley:ec02`, direct encoding schemes, employed in
    most cases, specify in the genome every connection and node that will appear
    in the phenotype. In contrast, indirect encodings usually only specify rules
    for constructing a phenotype. These rules can be layer specifications or
    growth rules through cell division.

    One of the goals of this base abstract class is to abstract those details
    for the user, defining a general interface for the different types of
    genomes used by the different neuroevolutionary algorithms in `flight_maneuvers.evolution`.
    Generally, for `flight_maneuvers.evolution`, there is no distinction between a genome and the
    network it encodes.

    A genome must be capable of processing inputs based on its nodes and
    connections in order to produce an output, emulating a neural network. It
    also must be able to mutate and to generate offspring, in order to evolve.

        fitness (float): The current fitness value of the genome.
