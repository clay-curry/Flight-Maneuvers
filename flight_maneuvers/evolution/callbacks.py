""" Defines a base interface for all callbacks and implements simple callbacks.

For NEvoPy, callbacks are utilities called at certain points during the
evolution of a population. They are a powerful tool to customize the behavior of
a neuroevolutionary algorithm.

Example:

    To implement your own callback, simply create a class that inherits from
    :class:`.Callback` and pass an instance of it to
    :meth:`.BasePopulation.evolve`.

    .. code-block:: python

        class MyCallback(Callback):

                print(f"Starting generation {current_generation} of "
