class NeatPopulation(BasePopulation):
    """ Population of individuals (genomes) to be evolved by the NEAT algorithm.

    Main class of `flight_maneuvers.evolution's` implementation of the NEAT algorithm. It represents
    a population of individuals (genomes) to be evolved. The correct term, in
    NEAT's case, is actually "community" (group of populations of two or more
    different species) rather than "population" (subset of individuals of one
    species), since NEAT divides its genomes into species. However, to maintain
    consistency with the neuroevolution literature, the term "population" is
    used.

    To use NEAT, most users will need to use only this class. It's main method,
    :meth:`.evolve()`, starts the evolutionary process. By providing a
    processing scheduler, the user is able to specify how the computation of the
    fitness of the population's genomes will occur (whether to use serial or
    parallel processing, CPU or GPU, etc).

    By default, a :class:`.PoolProcessingScheduler` is used. It implements
    parallel processing using (by default) all the CPU cores of the machine
    where the program is running. Alternatively, if you want to run the
    evolution process on multiple machines (cluster) you should check out the
    :class:`.RayProcessingScheduler`.

    Example:

        Suppose you have already defined a function called `fitness_func` that
        takes a genome as input and calculates its fitness. If the networks
        take 10 input values and outputs 3 values, here is how you can proceed
        to create and evolve a population of 100 genomes using the default
        settings and processing scheduler:

        .. code-block:: python

            def fitness_func(genome):
                \"\"\"
                Function that takes a genome as input and returns the genome's
                fitness (a float) as output.
                \"\"\"
                # ...


            # Creating and evolving a population:
            population = NeatPopulation(size=100,
                                        num_inputs=10,
                                        num_outputs=3)
            history = population.evolve(generations=100,
                                        fitness_function=fitness_func)

            # Visualizing the progression of the population's fitness:
            history.visualize()

            # Retrieving and visualizing the fittest genome of the population:
            best_genome = population.fittest()
            best_genome.visualize()

    Args:
        size (int): Number of genomes in the population (constant value).
        num_inputs (Optional[int]): Number of input nodes in each genome. If
            `None`, the number of inputs will be inferred from the base genome.
        num_outputs (Optional[int]): Number of output nodes in each genome. If
            `None`, the number of outputs will be inferred from the base genome.
        base_genome (Optional[NeatGenome]): Genome that will serve as a base for
            the randomly generated genomes of the population. If `None`, a new
            genome of the class :class:`.NeatGenome` will be used as the base
            genome.
        config (NeatConfig): The settings of the evolutionary process. If `None`
            the default settings will be used.
        processing_scheduler (Optional[ProcessingScheduler]): Processing
            scheduler to be used to compute the fitness of the population's
            genomes. If `None`, the default scheduler will be used
            :class:`.PoolProcessingScheduler`.

        """ Handles the reproduction of the population's genomes.

        This method implements the reproduction mechanism described in the
        original paper of the NEAT algorithm :cite:`stanley:ec02`.

        First, the most fit genomes of each species with more than a pre-defined
        number of individuals are selected to be passed unchanged to the next
        generation (elitism). Next, the least fit genomes of each species are
        discarded (reverse elitism). After that, the number of descendants of
        each species is calculated based on the proportion between the total
        fitness of the population and the adjusted fitness of the species
        (roulette wheel selection). Finally, the reproduction of individuals of
        the same species (and, on rare occasions, between genomes of different
        species as well) occurs.

        Genomes with a higher fitness have a higher chance of leaving offspring.
        Within a species, the chance of a genome reproducing is given by the
        position it occupies in the species fitness rank (rank-based selection).
        This means that the reproduction chance of a genome is not directly
        calculated from the genome's fitness, but rather from how well
        positioned is the genome in the fitness rank.

        Most of the behaviour described above can be adjusted by changing the
        settings of the evolutionary process (see :class:`.NeatConfig`).

        The importance of speciation for NEAT:

        "Speciating the population allows organisms to compete primarily within
        their own niches instead of with the population at large. This way,
        topological innovations are protected in a new niche where they have
        time to optimize their structure through competition within the niche.
        The idea is to divide the population into species such that similar
        topologies are in the same species." - :cite:`stanley:ec02`

        The distance (compatibility) between a pair of genomes is calculated
        based on to the number of excess and disjoint genes between them. See
        :meth:`.NeatGenome.distance()` for more information.

        About the speciation process:

        "Each existing species is represented by a random genome inside the
        species from the previous generation. A given genome g in the current
        generation is placed in the first species in which g is compatible with
        the representative genome of that species. This way, species do not
        overlap. If g is not compatible with any existing species, a new species
        is created with g as its representative." - :cite:`stanley:ec02`

        Species that haven't improved their fitness for a pre-defined number of
        generations are extinct, i.e., they are removed from the population
        and aren't considered for the speciation process. This number is
