class GeneticAlgorithmConfig:
    """ Stores the settings to be used by :class:`.GeneticPopulation`.

    Individual configurations can be ignored (default values will be used), set
    in the arguments of this class constructor or written in a file (pathname
    passed as an argument).

    Some parameters/attributes related to mutation chances expects a tuple with
    two floats, indicating the minimum and the maximum chance of the mutation
    occurring. A value within the given interval is chosen based on the "mass
    extinction factor" (mutation chances increases as the number of consecutive
    generations in which the population has shown no improvement increases). If
    you want a fixed mutation chance, just place the same value on both
    positions of the tuple.

    Todo:
        * Implementation: loading settings from a config file.
        * Specify the config file organization in the docs.

    Args:
        file_pathname (Optional[str]): The pathname of a file from where the
            settings should be loaded.
        **kwargs: Accepts any of the attributes listed for this class. When the
            value of an attribute isn't passed as argument, a default value is
            used. The default values are defined in
            :attr:`.GeneticAlgorithmConfig.ATTRIBUTES`.

    Attributes:
        mutation_chance (Tuple[float, float]): Chance for a mutation to occur
            in a new-born genome.
        weight_mutation_chance (Tuple[float, float]): Chance of each individual
            connection weight of a newborn genome being perturbed during
            mutation.
        weight_perturbation_pc (Tuple[float, float]): Maximum absolute
            percentage of a weight's value that can be added to it during
            mutation. When a connection weight is being mutated, it has a chance
            of being perturbed. This can me summarized as follows (`p` is the
            weight perturbation percentage):
            `current weight <- current weight * (1 + random[-p, p])`.
        weight_reset_chance (Tuple[float, float]): Chance, during mutation, for
            a weight to have its value reset (in which case a new random value
            is assigned to it).
        new_weight_interval (Tuple[float, float]): When a weight is reset, it
            will be assigned with a random value in this interval.

        weak_genomes_removal_pc (float): Percentage of the weakest genomes
            (those with the lowest fitness) to be removed before reproduction
            occurs.
        mating_chance (float): Chance of a genome reproducing sexually, i.e.,
            by mating / crossing-over with another genome. Decreasing this value
            increases the chance of a genome reproducing asexually, through
            binary fission (copy + mutation).
        mating_mode (str): How the exchange of genetic material is supposed to
            happen during a sexual reproduction between two genomes. Options:
            "weights_mating" and "exchange_layers" (the new genome inherits full
            layers from its parents).
        rank_prob_dist_coefficient (float): Coefficient :math:`\\alpha` used to
            calculate the probability distribution used to select genomes for
            reproduction. Basically, the value of this constant can be
            interpreted as follows: the genome with the highest fitness has
            :math:`\\times \\alpha` more chance of being selected for
            reproduction than the second best genome, which, in turn, has
            :math:`\\times \\alpha` more chance of being selected than the third
            best genome, and so forth. This approach to reproduction is called
            rank-based selection.
        predatism_chance (float): Chance of a newborn genome being "predated",
            in which case its replaced by a new randomly generated genome. This
            increases the genetic variability in the population.

        species_distance_threshold (float): Minimum distance between two genomes
            for them to be considered as being of the same species. A lower
            threshold will make new species easier to appear, increasing the
            number of species throughout the evolutionary process.
        species_elitism_threshold (int): Species with a number of members
            superior to this threshold will have one or more of their fittest
            members copied unchanged to the next generation.
        elitism_pc (float): Percentage of the genomes of a big enough species to
            be copied unchanged to the next generation. The number of copied
            genomes is equal to `max(1, ceil(species_size * elitism_pc))`.
        species_no_improvement_limit (int): If a species doesn't show
            improvement in its best fitness for this amount of generations, it
            will be removed from the species' list of the population.

        mass_extinction_threshold (int): If the population's fitness doesn't
            improve for this amount of generations, the whole population, with
            the exception of its fittest genome, will be extinct/deleted and
            replaced by new randomly generated genomes. Here the fitness of a
            population in a given generation is considered to be equal to the
            fitness of its fittest genome in that generation. As the number of
            generations without improvements increases, the mutations chances
            (as specified in the settings) also increase. This simulates the
            increase of the evolutionary pressure acting on the population.
        maex_improvement_threshold_pc (float): It's considered that the fitness
            of a population improved if, and only if, the population's fitness
            had an increase equivalent to this percentage. As an example,
            suppose that the fitness :math:`f_g` of a population on generation
            :math:`g` is 100 and that this parameter is set to `0.05` (`5%`).
            The fitness :math:`f_{g+1}` of the population in the next generation
            (`g + 1`) is considered to have improved if, and only if,
            :math:`f_{g+1} \\geq 1.05 \\cdot f_g = 105`.
